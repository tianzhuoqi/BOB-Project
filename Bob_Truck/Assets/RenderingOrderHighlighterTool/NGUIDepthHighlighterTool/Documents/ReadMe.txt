*****   USAGE
Each panel will take a colour from the rendering highlighter window (set automatically)
The panel icon has a red outline.
All Widgets drawn by this panel will take the same colour as the panel.

There are 5 NGUI icons right now. This number can be changed from NGUIHighlighterConstants.NUMBER_OF_NGUI_LAYERS.
If this number is increased, the number of icons needs to match this new value.
